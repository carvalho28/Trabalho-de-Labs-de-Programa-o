## Objectives of the Project
The objective of this project is to implement a program that asks the user 18
whole numbers and keep them in a vector, to later provide shape
to calculate some statistics or perform operations on those values.
The requested values must be between six and 28.

After the values have been requested, a menu is shown to the user who
allow you to calculate each of the statistics listed below, exactly
in the order placed in this statement. After choosing an option, the
The result should be shown on the screen, and the menu should be displayed again.

## Main Features of the Project
These are the main features implemented in the program:

  1 - Return of the vector in ascending order;

  2 - Calculation of the median of the elements in the vector;

  3 - Calculation of the multiplication of all elements in the vector by 3;

  4 - Construction of an 18x2 matrix, in which each line is composed of the vector
      read (first line) and four times the respective values (second line);

  5 - Calculation of the logarithm (natural basis) of all elements in the vector;

  6 - Return of values in multiple positions of three of the vector.

## Aditional Features of the Project
These features were implemented after the main objectives of the project were completed:

  1 - Reading a new vector, and returning a vector that mixes half of the
      first vector and half of the second;

  2 - Presentation of the decomposition in prime numbers of the odd numbers in the
      initial vector;

  3 - Reading a new 1x18 vector, calculating and returning the 18x18 matrix
      resulting from the product of the initial vector with the new vector generated;

  4 - Calculation and presentation of the transposed matrix referred to in the previous point;

  5 - The program additionally presents a help page, accessible as
      with entry seven on the menu;

  6 -  The program shows some help when it is run from the
      commands with the --help flag.
